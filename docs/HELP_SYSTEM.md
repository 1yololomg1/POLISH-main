## Processing Help

### Algorithm Selection

**Q: Which denoising algorithm should I use?**
A: **Savitzky-Golay** is recommended for most applications:
- **Best for**: Gamma ray, resistivity, porosity curves
- **Advantages**: Preserves geological features, reduces noise
- **Parameters**: Start with window size 11, polynomial order 3

**Q: When should I use wavelet denoising?**
A: Use **wavelet denoising** for:
- Complex noise patterns
- Non-stationary noise
- When Savitzky-Golay doesn't work well
- Very noisy data

**Q: How do I choose spike detection parameters?**
A: **Hampel filter** parameters:
- **Threshold 2.5**: Standard approach (recommended)
- **Threshold 3.0**: Conservative (fewer false positives)
- **Threshold 2.0**: Aggressive (more spike detection)

### Parameter Optimization

**Q: How do I optimize window size?**
```
Optimization Process:
1. Start with default (11 for Savitzky-Golay)
2. Increase for more smoothing
3. Decrease for feature preservation
4. Use odd numbers only
5. Test with visualization
```

**Q: What is the strength parameter?**
A: The strength parameter controls blending between original and processed data:
- **0%**: No processing applied
- **50%**: Equal blend (recommended start)
- **100%**: Full processing applied

**Q: How do I know if I'm over-processing?**
```
Warning Signs:
- Loss of geological features
- Over-smoothed curves
- Unrealistic values
- Poor quality score
- Geological inconsistency
```

### Quality Control

**Q: What do quality scores mean?**
```
Quality Grades:
A (90-100): Excellent - Ready for analysis
B (75-89):  Good - Light processing recommended
C (60-74):  Acceptable - Processing required
D (50-59):  Poor - Extensive processing needed
F (0-49):   Unacceptable - Consider re-logging
```

**Q: How do I improve quality scores?**
```
Improvement Strategies:
1. Adjust processing parameters
2. Use appropriate algorithms
3. Check physical validation
4. Review geological context
5. Iterate processing steps
```
